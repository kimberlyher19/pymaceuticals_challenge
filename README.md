Module 5 Challenge

Matplotlib using a real-world situation and dataset.


In this Pymaceuticals challenge, I referenced a lot of my codes from the class activities 
and used ChatGPT to assist when my codes weren't running properly. 


This was a very challenging module overall; however, it was also fun learning how 
to create the visual graphs.
